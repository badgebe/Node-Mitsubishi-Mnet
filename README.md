Node-Mitsubishi-Mnet
====================

I plan to start this off as an app to suit 'my purposes'** to interact with my controller and later to convert it into a module.

A node.js module to interact with mitsubishi Mnet controllers

** myPurposes = 'an app to interface yealink phones with my mitsubishi controller' :)
